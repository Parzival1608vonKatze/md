 # Why Every Software Engineer Uses MacBook.. by Soleyman Shahir
---------------------------------------------------------------
* 1. You can install a good Terminal Emulator on any OS and NO that what yo're talking about isn't strictly "the command-line" it is a terminal emulator
* 2. Unix is a very old OS and it isn't getting developed anymore (since a few decades). OSX isn't even based on Unix. It's based on BSD and that is based on Unix. OSX is a unix-like OS. (And btw. it takes you literally ONE web-search to get this info)
* (3. You can't even call OSX , OSX . It is not named MacOS anymore)
* 4. And most people would be better of with GNU/Linux anyway
* 5. You can run Virtual-Mashines (Operating systems in OSes) on most OSes (and btw. KVM performs the best!)
* 6. have you ever compared the lowest Price MacBook to the lowest priced Windows PC (TIP: the lowest priced Windows PC costs less and is therefore made of lower grade Materials => obviously a 250 euro Laptop breaks easier than a 1500 euro Laptop [MacBook]
* 7. You can get all of those Ports ('plug and play solutions') on any other mid-range Laptop
* 8. Battery life on Windows-Mashines is $h*t (we know that) but as I sed the lowest priced Windows Laptop costs like 250 euro! You can't compare that. And have you ever seen Battery life of a GNU/Linux distro (TIP: it's longe/better than on Windows and OSX)
* 9. There is are more Programs for Windows because more People use Windows!
* 10. “3x more windows laptops breaking than mac machines” There’s like 8x more windows laptops being used
BTW. we all know that Windows sucks but OSX ain't much better! Read the comments on this Video every one says that!
Maybe you should do a bit of research before your next post on this site. And maybe you'll get a like to dislike ratio that is better than 4.2/1! STOP TRASH TALKING
